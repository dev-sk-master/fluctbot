# Parallel Image Processor

Demonstrates how AsyncParallelBatchFlow processes multiple images with multiple filters >8x faster than sequential processing.

## Features

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AsyncParallelBatchFlow[Image Processing Flow]
        subgraph AsyncFlow[Per Image-Filter Flow]
            A[Load Image] --> B[Apply Filter]
            B --> C[Save Image]
        end
    end
```

- Processes images with multiple filters in parallel
- Applies three different filters (grayscale, blur, sepia)
- Shows significant speed improvement over sequential processing
- Manages system resources with semaphores

## Run It

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Output

## Key Points

- **Sequential**: Total time = sum of all item times

  - Good for: Rate-limited APIs, maintaining order

- **Parallel**: Total time ≈ longest single item time
  - Good for: I/O-bound tasks, independent operations
